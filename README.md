# Airline Market Demand Dashboard

This is a Flask-based web application that analyzes airline flight data to provide market insights for the hospitality industry, specifically for a chain of hostels in Australia. The dashboard visualizes flight price trends and route popularity, and it uses the Google Gemini API to generate an AI-powered summary of the data.

## Features

-   **Dynamic Destination Analysis:** Select a destination city in Australia to analyze inbound flight data from other major Australian cities.
-   **Interactive Charts:**
    -   **Average Price by Origin Route:** A bar chart showing the average flight prices from different origins to the selected destination.
    -   **Interactive Daily Price Trend:** A line chart showing the daily price trend for a specific route over the next 30 days. Click on a route in the bar chart to dynamically update this trend chart.
-   **AI-Powered Insights:** A summary generated by Google's Gemini AI that provides actionable marketing advice based on the flight price data.
-   **Responsive Design:** The dashboard is designed to be usable on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### 1. Prerequisites

-   Python 3.7 or higher
-   `pip` (Python package installer)

### 2. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

### 3. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

It's a good practice to create a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**On Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. API Key Configuration

This project uses a `.env` file to manage API keys for security.

1.  **Create a `.env` file:**
    -   In the root of the project folder, create a new file named `.env`.
    -   Copy the contents of the `.env.example` file into your new `.env` file.

2.  **Get Your API Keys:**
    -   **Amadeus:** Get your API Key and Secret from the Amadeus for Developers portal.
    -   **Google Gemini:** Get your API Key from Google AI Studio.

3.  **Add Keys to `.env` file:**
    -   Open your `.env` file and replace the placeholder values with your actual keys. The file should look like this:
    ```env
    AMADEUS_API_KEY="your_actual_amadeus_key"
    AMADEUS_API_SECRET="your_actual_amadeus_secret"
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your_actual_gemini_key"
    ```
    The `.env` file is listed in `.gitignore`, so your secret keys will not be committed to your repository.

## Running the Application

Once the setup is complete, you can run the Flask application with the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will start in debug mode and will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your web browser.

## How to Use the Dashboard

1.  **Select a Destination:** Use the dropdown menu to choose a destination city you want to analyze.
2.  **Analyze Demand:** Click the "Analyze Demand" button to fetch and display the data.
3.  **View Insights:**
    -   The **AI-Powered Summary** gives you a quick overview and marketing advice.
    -   The **Average Price by Origin Route** chart shows which cities have cheaper or more expensive flights to your destination.
    -   The **Daily Price Trend** chart initially shows the trend for the first route in the list.
4.  **Interact with Charts:** Click on any bar in the "Average Price by Origin Route" chart to see the 30-day price trend for that specific route in the line chart below it.
